## üìñ Configuration

### Banking System Setup
The script supports two modes depending on your banking system:

#### For Banking Systems with Static Identifiers (IBAN, Account Numbers)
```lua
Banking = {
    hasStaticIdentifiers = true,
    noIdentifierMessage = 'Your banking system does not support automatic payments'
}
```

#### For Banking Systems without Static Identifiers
```lua
Banking = {
    hasStaticIdentifiers = false,
    noIdentifierMessage = 'Your banking system does not support automatic payments'
}
```

When `hasStaticIdentifiers = false`:
- Auto-renewal features are disabled
- Bank account linking is hidden
- Only manual payments are available
- Grace period and deletion systems still work

### Banking Functions
Edit the banking functions in `server/main.lua` (lines 14-37):

```lua
-- Example Integration with RxBanking
Banking.GetPlayerAccount = function(identifier)
    local accountData = exports['RxBanking']:GetPlayerPersonalAccount(identifier)
    if type(accountData) == "table" then
        return accountData.iban
    elseif type(accountData) == "string" then
        return accountData
    end
    return nil
end

Banking.RemoveAccountMoney = function(accountId, amount, unitId)
    return exports['RxBanking']:RemoveAccountMoney(
        accountId, 
        amount, 
        'payment', 
        locale('storage_unit_autorenewal', { id = unitId }), 
        nil
    )
end
```

### Storage Configuration
Configure storage units in `config.lua`:

```lua
Storages = {
    { 
        name = 'storageunit1',  
        id = 1,  
        coords = vector3(-73.26, -1196.35, 27.66), 
        length = 5.0, 
        width = 5.4, 
        minZ = 25.86, 
        maxZ = 29.86, 
        heading = 0 
    },
    -- Add more units...
}
```

### Pricing Configuration
```lua
Pricing = {
    enableRent = true,  -- Allow renting
    enableBuy = true,   -- Allow purchasing
    rent = 1000,        -- Weekly rental price
    purchase = 25000,   -- One-time purchase price
    
    upgrades = {
        slots_tier1 = {
            name = "Extra Storage Slots",
            description = "Increase storage slots by 25",
            price = 2500,
            effect = { type = "slots", value = 25 },
            stackable = true,
            maxStack = 3
        },
        -- Add more upgrades...
    }
}
```
